        <h1>Amazon Pick me!</h1>

        <p>
                Cities across the U.S are competing to attract Amazon’s second head quarters which would bring 50,000 jobs and $5 billion investment. Out of the original 238 cities, 20 cities made it the final cut.
                If Amazon were a person (Yes…corporations are people!) which city should he choose? 
                We are here to help!

        <p>
                Metropolitan areas with more than one million people.
                (Spoiler Alert : All the 20 shortlisted cities meet this criteria.)
               
               A stable and business-friendly environment.
               Communities that think big and creatively when considering locations and real estate options.
                Non quantifiable metrics. We assumed all the cities meet this criteria as well.
               
               Urban or suburban locations with the potential to attract and retain strong technical talent.
